    C "Belial!"
    $[Belial] = "Bel"                                                          
    B "Aye that's me! I hear ya!"
    B "Give me a moment please! there is a ton of dishes that need some good cleanin'!"
    "The voice of what sounds like a young man with a funny accent answers her"
    C "It's me, Charna!"
    B "Ah! Girl! What brings ya here?"
    C "I brought someone from the main city!"
    C "They had some questions, I didn't want to stay out in the night, se we came here"
    "..."
    "We are only met with silence, [Charna] just awaits a response, silently"
    "..."
    C "Belial?"
    B "Ya, ya, sorry, I got caught up processing what you just told me"
    "Is it so rare to have people from the city coming over?"
    B "We were about to close ya know?"
    C "I'm sorry Belial, but I really needed a place to stay for a while and you were the closest"
    "[Belial] softly interrupts her"
    B "Alright, alright girl, I understand, take a seat wherever you please"
    "[Charna] nods and then looks at me"
    C "Let's go"
    M "Lead the way miss"
    #Charna Talks
    "We take a seat"
    "The window is at the opposite side of our table, we are looking at each other"
    "Before I can address her, she initiates the conversation"
    "The sweet aroma of the coffee still permeating the local"
    C "I may have some useful information, but I expect that you also share some with me"
    "Damn it"
    "This situation crossed my mind but I hoped that nothing happened"
    "I haven't gotten any new information since I arrived so I hopped at the chance to get new info when she showed up"
    "I should try to get her information first, it is prohibited to tell citizens the details about our cases"
    M "I'm afraid I can't do that miss, I was ordered to be secretive about our findings"
    C "..."
    "She looks unhappy"
    C "I won't accept a no for an answer, I won't ignore a chain or murders that is taking place in my hometown"
    M "..."
    "Charna's expression is very serious"
    "The sweet aroma of coffee permeates the room"
    C "The corpses are found naked in desolate and dark places of the town, their clothes sprawled around the streets, seemingly following the trail the victim went through"
    M "Yes, that is how we have found them"
    C "The clothes are in almost perfect state, they weren't yanked off or ripped apart from the victims"
    M "We think that these were taken off willingly by the victim"
    "Charna suddenly looks more interested, she continues"
    C "They all have various scratch marks in their bodies, especially in the back, the amount of lines indicate that the attacker has 4 claws"
    C "However, these marks cannot be the cause of decease, while they have bled from them, they aren't deep enough to kill a person"
    "I... didn't know that..."
    C "Another interesting bit is, no one heard their screams, you'd think that the victims would call out for help when attacked"
    C "But it seems that is not the case"
    C "They willingly go to a dark secluded place at night, get attacked and just accept it?"
    M "..."
    "Charna looks at me, it almost feels like her gaze penetrates my flesh"
    C "I've already told you plenty details, so tell me Mr detective"
    C "What conclusion have your higher ups came to?"
    "I was only informed about the basics about this case before arriving"
    "That and my only instructions were to just come here and get more info"
    "While I did get new details, seems that this village girl did a way better job at investigating than both the guards and forensic team"
    C "I'm waiting for an answer"
    "Charna has her eyes fixated on me, waiting for an answer"
    "I should try to come up with something"
    M "The victims must have been drunk"
    C "mhm?"
    M "Drunken people have both their reasoning and senses dulled"
    M "We think that the killer must be intoxicating the victims and then murdering them once they are far away"
    C "..."
    "I can't read her expression"
    C "How does that explain the undressing...?"
    M "..."
    C "That would be a good explanation if it there were few murders"
    C "But it is hard to believe that many people were silently lured out to the dark"
    C "Especially if they were drunk"
    M "It is just an hyphotesis based on what we know"
    C "May I ask why you haven't mentioned the possibility of monsters being involved?"
    M "huh?"
    C "You are either hiding that or for some reason you think it is not"
